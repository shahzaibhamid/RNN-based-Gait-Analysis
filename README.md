# RNN-based-Gait-Analysis
This repository focuses on Recurrent Neural Network based algorithm for Gait Analysis.
The codes available in this repository are based on Python.
The code available in this repository comes after the complete Pose Estimation based Computer Vision based Techniques.
There are multiple Computer vision based Techniques that come before that such as OpenPose, DeepCut, DensePose, PoseNet and AlphaPose.
This specific repository follows the dataset taken from OpenPose Technique.
